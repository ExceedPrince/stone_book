# stone_book

This is a solo exercise from the CodeCool's Frontend Developer course.

At half time our mentor asked us to to a stone book, and we should found out at least 3 rules about what should we pay more attention in HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Everyone's rules are different. I tried to make this a little special so I played a little with the animations, but I didn't want to overdo it.
